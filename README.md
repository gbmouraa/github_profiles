# Github profile finder

Build with HTML, SASS, Javascript!

This is a project using the github API to search for profiles on the platform, when doing the search some profile information is also shown, such as followers, following, number of repos and five repos (if any) as links.

## My process

For me it was a big challenge to do this project, because I'm still learning the principles of Javascript, but despite the code being huge, I'm happy with the result because it works!!!:smiley: :ok_hand: !!
As I add more knowledge, I will refactor the code so that it becomes more and more performatively readable
